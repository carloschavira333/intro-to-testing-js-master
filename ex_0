Exercise #0 - look, guess, test, conclude
1. change the name of the helloWorld function to hello. Then refresh report.html in your browser.
    a. Open report.html
    b. Open code.js > change helloWorld() to hello()
    c. refresh browser
    d. Answer these questions:
        What do you notice about the test results? 4 specs and 4 failures
        What are some ways you think we could get the tests to turn green again? Change hello() to helloWorld()
    e. Open code.js > change hello() to helloWorld()
2. Inside of the helloWorld function in code.js, replace return "Hello, World!" with return "Hello".
    g. Run the tests by refreshing report.html in your browser.
    h. Answer these questions:
        Which tests fail? should return the string "Hello, World!" when executed
        Which tests are still green?
        should be a defined function
        should never return 'undefined' when called
        should return a string when called
    i. Change back to "Hello, World!"
3. Inside of the helloWorld function in code.js, change the line return "Hello, World!" to console.log("Hello, World!").
    k. Then refresh report.html.
    l. Answer questions:
        What happens to the tests? 3 fails and 1 pass
        Identify which tests stay green and which ones turn red.
            Turn red:
                should return the string "Hello, World!" when executed
                should never return 'undefined' when called
                should return a string when called
            Stayed green?
                should be a defined function
        Why do you think that is? Because one of the tests was checking for a defined function and we still have a defined function.
        (Consider, what is the return value of a console.log? hint, it's always the same
        Consider, what is the return value of a return?)
    m. Fix your helloWorld implementation so that it greens all the tests.
4. Now, let's purposefully put a syntax error into the helloWorld function, to see what happens with the tests.
    a. Open up code.js and remove the closing curly brace from the end of the helloWorld function definition.
    b. Refresh report.html in your browser.
    c. Fix the syntax error and confirm that tests are all green.
5. Now, go to code.js and
    a. replace the function statement for helloWorld with a function experession.
        // function statement syntax
        function helloWorld() {
            return "Hello, World!";
        }
        // function expression syntax (assigning an anonymous function to a variable)
        const helloWorld = function() {
            return "Hello, World!";
        }
    b. Do all the tests stay green or not? Yes

    Why? According to the notes these two functions are interchangeable because functions are first class citizens in the JS language.
    (Double check your syntax. These are interchangeable because functions are first class citizens in the JS language.)
    c. Before moving on, ensure that all tests are green.
