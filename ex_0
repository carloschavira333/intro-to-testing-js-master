Exercise #0 - look, guess, test, conclude
1. change the name of the helloWorld function to hello. Then refresh report.html in your browser.
    a. Open report.html
    b. Open code.js > change helloWorld() to hello()
    c. refresh browser
    d. Answer these questions:
        What do you notice about the test results?
        What are some ways you think we could get the tests to turn green again?
    e. Open code.js > change hello() to helloWorld()
2. Inside of the helloWorld function in code.js, replace return "Hello, World!" with return "Hello".
    g. Run the tests by refreshing report.html in your browser.
    h. Answer these questions:
        Which tests fail? Which tests are still green?
    i. Change back to "Hello, World!"
3. Inside of the helloWorld function in code.js, change the line return "Hello, World!" to console.log("Hello, World!").
    k. Then refresh report.html.
    l. Answer questions:
        What happens to the tests? Identify which tests stay green and which ones turn red.
        Why do you think that is?
        Consider, what is the return value of a console.log? hint, it's always the same
        Consider, what is the return value of a return?
    m. Fix your helloWorld implementation so that it greens all the tests.
4. Now, let's purposefully put a syntax error into the helloWorld function, to see what happens with the tests.
    a. Open up code.js and remove the closing curly brace from the end of the helloWorld function definition.
    b. Refresh report.html in your browser.
    c. Fix the syntax error and confirm that tests are all green.
5. Now, go to code.js and
    a. replace the function statement for helloWorld with a function experession.
        // function statement syntax
        function helloWorld() {
            return "Hello, World!";
        }
        // function expression syntax (assigning an anonymous function to a variable)
        const helloWorld = function() {
            return "Hello, World!";
        }
    b. Do all the tests stay green or not? Why or why not? Double check your syntax. These are interchangeable because functions are first class citizens in the JS language.
    c. Before moving on, ensure that all tests are green.
