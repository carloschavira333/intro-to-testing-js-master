Exercise #2 Ensure our function returns the right data type.
New tests will each have their own expect, it, the describe

Step 1: The smallest possible test, now that the function exists, is to ensure that calling the function gives us a string. Inside of tests.js, add an assertion to sayHello that it "should return a string when called.". The test should look similar to expect(typeof sayHello()).toBe("string")
    a. Add an it with 'should return a string when called.'
    b. Add an expect to be a "string"



Step 2: Run all tests to make sure that the new test starts red.


Step 3: Have your sayHello function return a string. The simplest code and smallest change possible is to return an empty string return "".


Step 4: Now, run all the tests to ensure that the previously red test is now turned green by our impelementation.
    Result: All tests are green

Step 5: There's nothing to refactor.


Step 6: Repeat (Repeat the process by moving to build the next, small test)
