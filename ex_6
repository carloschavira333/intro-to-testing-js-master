Exercise #6 Implement the refactor!

Inside sayHello in code.js, what's a change you can identify that will improve the overall functioning of this function?


Can you get the implmentation of sayHello down to a function with only one line of code inside?


If we have return "Hello, " + input + "!";, does this work for all names?


Does this bring up any other issues with other inputs?
